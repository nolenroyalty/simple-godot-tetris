# simple-godot-tetris

A ~trivial implementation of tetris in godot, written to get a feel for how to use godot. This is my first time writing anything in Godot
so the code is probably not very idiomatic. I also didn't realize how miserable it is to reorganize files in godot after you've referenced
them so I haven't bothered to go back and reorganize things, which means the repo is a bit of a mess. But you seem pretty reasonable
so I'm sure you'll forgive me for that.

Here's a quick demo:
